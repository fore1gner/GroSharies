# GroSharies

Welcome to the GroSharies repository! GroSharies is a smart application designed to reduce food waste and encourage sustainable behavior among consumers. By tracking the items in your fridge, notifying you of expiring products, and providing a platform to share leftovers with your community, GroSharies aims to make a positive impact on food sustainability.

## Group Effectiveness
Our multidisciplinary team consists of six members from various fields: Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Industrial Design, Psychology & Technology, and Computer Science. This diverse background enabled a comprehensive approach to the project. Responsibilities were divided based on individual strengths, ensuring effective development of the app.

## Design Goal
The primary goal of GroSharies is to address the issue of food waste by creating an application that tracks food items, notifies users of expiring products, and facilitates sharing of leftovers within a community. This app is intended for household use, aiming to make sustainable behavior easy and accessible. **The app can be found in this [link](https://grosharies.glideapp.io/).**

## Functional Design and Solutions
Using the MoSCoW prioritization method, we identified key functions for GroSharies:
- **Must Have**: Clear and easy-to-use design, product tracking, and expiration notifications.
- **Should Have**: Community platform for sharing food, notifications for expiring products.
- **Could Have**: Barcode scanning, shopping list integration, recipe suggestions, and sustainability statistics.
- **Won’t Have**: Health or financial advice, suggestions on product sustainability.

## Concept Designs
Several initial ideas were considered, including a smart fridge and a waste awareness trash can. Ultimately, the concept of an application combining a smart fridge with a food-sharing community was chosen for its feasibility and impact.

## Final Concept Design
The final design of GroSharies includes:
- A digital fridge to track products and expiration dates.
- A community platform for sharing food items.
- A shopping list feature.
- Notifications and reminders for expiring products.

## Technical Specification
The app was developed using the Glide platform, with data stored in an external Google Sheet. Key functions include:
- Tracking food items with expiration dates.
- Community platform for sharing food.
- Notifications for expiring products.
- Barcode scanning and recipe suggestions.

## Detailing
The app's key features include:
- **Data and Database**: A Google Sheet database tracks products, expiration dates, and recipes.
- **Community Part & Live Chat**: A real-time chat system for sharing food within the community.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Scanning barcodes to quickly add products to the fridge.

## Realization
The development process included creating a mind map to visualize the design stages, using the MoSCoW method for prioritizing features, and continuous reflection to ensure all desired functions were implemented.

## Test Plan
A user validation test was conducted via a questionnaire to assess the app's potential impact and user interest. The results indicated strong interest and potential for reducing food waste.

## Design Evaluation
GroSharies successfully meets its design goals of being innovative, user-friendly, and focused on sustainability. Future improvements could include location-based community chats, more recipes, and integration between the shopping list and fridge inventory.
